## Ilustrator: Create Vector Graphics That Scale to Any Size
 
Ilustrator is the best choice for creating logos, icons, illustrations, and other vector graphics that can be resized without losing quality. You can use flexible shape and drawing tools to create complex and detailed designs, or use the Pen tool to draw smooth curves and paths. You can also edit and customize text in many ways to create striking typography. Ilustrator lets you work with multiple artboards, layers, symbols, gradients, patterns, effects, and more. You can also import and export files in various formats, such as SVG, EPS, PDF, and AI.
 
## Indesign: Design and Publish Multipage Documents
 
Indesign is the best choice for designing and publishing magazines, books, catalogs, flyers, brochures, and other print or digital documents that contain text, images, and vector graphics. You can use precise grids and guides to position page elements and create consistent layouts. You can also take advantage of professional typesetting features to format text across pages, chapters, and publications. Indesign lets you work with master pages, styles, tables, footnotes, cross-references, hyperlinks, interactive elements, and more. You can also export your document as PDF, EPUB, HTML, or publish it online with a single click.
 
## Photoshop: Edit and Enhance Pixel-Based Images
 
Photoshop is the best choice for editing and enhancing photos, illustrations, web designs, videos, animations, and other pixel-based images. You can use powerful editing tools to correct exposure and color balance, crop and straighten images, alter colors in your photograph, remove blemishes from a portrait, or combine multiple images into a new scene. Photoshop lets you work with layers, masks, filters, adjustments, smart objects, brushes, shapes, text layers, and more. You can also create 3D content or edit 3D models in Photoshop.
